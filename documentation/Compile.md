Compiling Rwb
=============

First checkout or download [Wiki-java](https://github.com/vonloxley/wiki-java)
and install via ```mvn install```, then call mvn install to build librwb.

To rebuild the parser Bot.jj youâ€™ll need a fairly recent JavaCC (6.1_2 as of now).
After changing Bot.jj run `make` in the `src/Rwb/BotParser`-folder.
